This is a Assignment we are creating for the course RBE577 - Machine Learning for Robotics.

Students are required to implement the following algorithms:

1. A3C
2. DDPG

on the KukaDiverseObjectEnv environment.

The repository is organized as follows:

- `A3C.py` - Implementation of the A3C algorithm
- `DDPG.py` - Implementation of the DDPG algorithm
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for the project


now modify the code to have a proper structure and make it more robust and easier to understand.
